![Button Example](/assets/bsbutton.png)

`BsButton` is a standard, Beat Saber-styled button that contains a label. It's the most common way to handle user clicks.

```csharp
new BsButton {
    Text = "Click Me",
    OnClick = () => Debug.Log("Button was clicked!")
}.AsFlexItem()
```

## Key Properties
- `OnClick`: An `Action` that is invoked when the button is clicked.
- `Text`: The text to display on the button. It also exposes other `Label` properties like `FontSize`, `FontStyle`, etc.
- `Interactable`: A boolean that controls whether the button can be clicked.
