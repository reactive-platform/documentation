![WebImage Example](/assets/webimage.png)

`WebImage` is a powerful extension of `Image` that automatically handles downloading and displaying an image from a URL. It includes a built-in loading spinner.

```csharp
new WebImage {
    Src = "https://placehold.co/800x200/000000/FFFFFF/png?text=WebImage+Example"
}.AsFlexItem(size: new() { x = 20, y = 5 })
```

## Extension

It's possible to load web image on any `Image` with extension method:

```csharp
new Image()
.AsFlexItem(size: new() { x = 20, y = 5 })
.WithWebSource("https://placehold.co/800x200/000000/FFFFFF/png?text=WebImage+Example")
```
However, this won't show spinner and empty default sprite.

## File types

- PNG
- JPG
- GIF (animations are supported)

## Key Properties
- `Src`: The source URL of the image to download. If the `Src` is changed, the component will automatically fetch the new image. If set to `null` or an empty string, the image will be cleared.
- It inherits all other properties from `Image`, like `Color`, `Material`, etc.
- `Spinner`: The `Spinner` component that is showed during the loading.
